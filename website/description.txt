in this folder we describe the logic behind controllers.

We create a blueprint per every unique screen of our app. For that screen, in blueprints we may assign various routes, and business logic on what to do when a route is accessed. 

For example, in this project login functionality has a dedicated blueprint, and all other screens are placed within the views blueprint (which makes sense for single-page-applications).
