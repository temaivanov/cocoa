Files in this directory are templates that will extend the base html file.

E.g. if in base html we have:

{% block title %}Home{% endblock %}

and in the home.html that extends the base html, we have:

{% block title %}Changed{% endblock %}

then, the exact element will be changed in home.html, and the rest will be identical to base html.

To render templates, user render_templates inside of the Blueprints.

E.g.:

@views.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template(home.html)
